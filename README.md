# Weather Forecasting Project ðŸŒ¦

This repository contains the work for a lecture project at **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, focused on the application of advanced forecasting methods to real-world weather data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate different forecasting models on weather-related datasets. By using a combination of time series analysis, statistical models, and machine learning techniques, we aim to predict key meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

## Methods Applied

The notebook includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for time series data  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Classical forecasting methods such as ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing  
- Machine learning-based forecasting models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Evaluation using forecasting accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE)  

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Statsmodels  
- XGBoost  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## File Structure

- `PythonandAdvancedDataScience.Group3.Weatherforecast.ipynb`:  
  Main notebook containing all code, analysis, and results.

## Results

We compare model performance across multiple weather parameters to determine which methods provide the most accurate short-term and long-term forecasts. The findings are discussed and visualized throughout the notebook.

## Team & Acknowledgements
